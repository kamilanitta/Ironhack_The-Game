# Project: Where's Wally?

About the Game
--------------

Your journey takes you across 4 scenarios. Your goal is to find Wally as quickly as you can and click on his image! After every finding you are given a score point.
Take note, though: Your “click” must be very precise. If you don’t land exactly on Wally’s spot, it doesn’t recognize it as a right answer.

So what is the story?

The world famous globe-trotter in stripes is back on the road and inviting you along for the ride! Join Wally as he embarks on this fantastic journey.
